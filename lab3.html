<h2>
CS372 Project 3 - An Atomic Disk</h2>
<p>
<b>Due: </b>11:59:59 PM April 10, 2006</p>
</center>

<h3>
Assignment Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To learn about a key file system concept: logging</li>

<li>
To provide the basis for project 4, where you will build a reliable file system.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Overview of Project</h3>

<blockquote>In projects 3 and 4, you will construct a user-level library that presents the
  abstraction of a reliable file system called RFS. In order to manage the complexity, you
  will implement this system in 4 phases, each of which presents a successively
  higher-level abstraction. You will be given the abstraction of a raw disk
  interface. On top of this you will build
  <ol>
    <li>An atomic disk</li>
    <li>A reliable dynamically-growing multi-level tree</li>
    <li>A reliable flat file system</li>
    <li>A reliable directory-based file system (RFS)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This project, project 3, deals only with step 1 above. It is very important
  to do an excellent job on this part of the project, or you will have
  significant problems in the next part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
The Assignment</h3>

<blockquote>Before you begin the assignment, grab the following
code: <a href="cs372-proj3-4-2006.tar.gz">cs372-proj3-4-2006.tar.gz</a>
<p>This tar archive contains the source code to the raw disk interface as well
as the .h files defining the other interfaces listed below. To extract the files from the archive, use the following command.
<blockquote><tt>tar -xvzf cs372-proj3-4-2006.tar.gz</tt></blockquote>
  A directory called <b><tt>cs372-proj3-4-2006/</tt></b> will be created,
and your files will be extracted into it.

  <p class="MsoNormal">RFS will be implemented using an 8-Mbyte disk with a
  &quot;device driver&quot; that treats the storage space as a contiguous array
  of raw disk sectors, each of size DISK_SECTOR_SIZE bytes. This driver is similar to popular
  SCSI disk drivers. The disk sectors are numbered from 0 to
  DISK_<i>NUM_OF_SECTORS</i>- 1 inclusive. (All constants are defined
  in file <a href="common.h">common.h</a>  
  that will be made available to you). No partial read or write to a disk sector is
  possible. This important restriction has several implications on the design of
  the file system. For example, updating a single byte in a disk sector requires
  that the sector be read in memory, modified, and then written back to disk.
  Similarly, reading a single byte in a disk sector requires that the sector be
  read entirely from disk though only one byte is to be read.</p>

  <p>As the file <A HREF="Disk.h">Disk.h</A> and <A
  HREF="Disk.cc">Disk.cc</A> indicate, for the purpose of this
  project, the device driver supports two main calls to  
  operate on the disk. Both return either a success or a failure code depending
  on the result:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"><b>OpResult

      function reads the disk sector numbered <i>sectorNum</i> and places them

    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"><b>OpResult
      Disk::WriteSector(int sectorNum, char * dataPtr): </b>This function writes
      the disk sector numbered <i>sectorNum</i>. The data to be written to disk
      are available in a buffer starting at address <i>dataPtr<b>.</b></i></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="MsoNormal">OpResult is a type defined in <a href="common.h">common.h</a>.
  A ReadSector or WriteSector operation fails and returns an error code if:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo6; tab-stops: list .5in"><i>sectorNum</i>
      does not refer to a valid disk sector
  </ol>

  For convience in testing, the Disk also has an interface that causes the system to occasionally fail at random times. (Of course, a real disk driver probably would not include this interface.) Notice that writes to sectors are atomic -- either the sector is completely written with the data you specify or the write has no effect.

<blockquote>Your first task is to design, implement, and thouroughly test an <i>atomic disk.</i>
  The atomic disk allows a series of writes to different sectors to be made and
  then atomically applied -- either all the writes occur or none of them do. The
  atomic disk presents a similar interface to the disk, except (a) each read and
  write includes a transaction ID and (b) there are additional calls to begin,
  commit, abort, and apply transactions. You will implement this atomicity by
  providing an undo log on disk This undo log will consume ADISK_UNDO_LOG_SECTORS
  sectors of your disk, so users of the ADisk will see a DISK_NUM_OF_SECTORS -
  ADISK_UNDO_LOG_SECTORS disk.&nbsp;
  <p>In particular, an <A HREF="ADisk.h">ADisk</A> implements the
  following interface:</p>
  <b>ADisk::ADisk(Disk
  d)</b>: This function is the constructor. It should initialize your
  internal state, read the log, and
  undo any transactions that were in-progress (uncommitted and
  unaborted) when the crash occurred, and finally reset the log.
  <p><b>int
  ADisk::getNSectors()</b>: This function returns the total number of data sectors on
  the atomic disk that can be used, not including the space on the disk used for the log. <b>Note</b>:
  this number will be smaller than <i>DISK_NUM_OF_SECTORS</i>.
  <p><b>TransID
  ADisk::beginTransaction()</b>: This function performs any necessary processing
  to begin a new transaction and returns a transaction ID that can identify the
  newly created transaction.
  <p><b>OpResult
  ADisk::commitTransaction(TransID xid)</b>: This function marks the log to
  indicate that the specified transaction has committed, which means that after
  a crash, all writes for the specified transaction must survive.
  <p><b>OpResult
  ADisk::abortTransaction(TransID xid)</b>: This function rolls back
  the state of the data store to undo the effect of all writes issued
  in this transaction. Once this is done, it marks the transaction in
  the log as aborted.
  <p><b>OpResult
  ADisk::readSector(TransID xid, int sectorNum, char * dataPtr):<span style="COLOR: green"> </span></b>This
  function reads the disk sector numbered <i>sectorNum</i> and places it in
  the buffer starting at address <i>dataPtr<b>. Note: </b></i> the result of a
  read of a sector must reflect all previous committed writes as well as any
  uncommitted writes that are part of the same transaction. The read should not
  reflect writes from other active transactions or writes from aborted
  transactions.
  <p><b>OpResult
  ADisk::writeSector(TransID xid, int sectorNum, char * dataPtr):
  </b>This function copies the current contents of the disk sector
  <I>sectorNum</I> to the undo log and then overwrites that sector
  with new data. The data to be written to disk are
  available in a buffer starting at address <i>dataPtr<b>.</b></i>

  <p class="MsoNormal">OpResult is a type defined in <a href="common.h">common.h</a>.
  A commitTransaction, abortTransaction, readSector, or writeSector operation
  fails and returns an error code if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>xid</i> does not refer to an active
      transaction&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, a readSector or writeSector operation fails
  and returns an error code if:</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo6; tab-stops: list .5in"><i>sectorNum</i>
      does not refer to a valid disk sector
  </ol>
  <p>Finally, a writeSector operation fails and returns an error if:</p>
  <ol start="3">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto;
  mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo6; tab-stops:
  list .5in">More than <I>MAX_WRITES_PER_TRANSACTION</I> have been
  issued for this transaction.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Concurrency</b></p>
  <p>Note that your implementation must use locks and
      condition variables to enforce concurrency control. </p>

  <p>Your implementation must allow up to
  <I>MAX_CONCURRENT_WRITES_PER_TRANSACTION</I> concurrent transactions. A
  call to <I>beginTransaction</I> should block until there are fewer
  than <I>MAX_CONCURRENT_WRITERS_PER_TRANSACTION</I> in-progress
  transactions.</LI>

  <p>Multiple threads may concurrently attempt to
  read/write/commit/abort the same transaction. Your code must
  synchronize such concurrent access.</p>

  <p>You are <b>not</b> required to enforce readers/writers or mutex
  locking of disk sectors across transactions. For example, the
  following series of events is legal: 
  transaction 1 could write sector 42, transaction 2 could read the
  old data from sector 42, then transaction 1 could commit, then
  transaction 2 could commit.  (If an application wants stronger
  consistency guarantees in the face of concurrent reads/writes of
  disk sectors, the application would provide readers/writers locking
  in a layer above ADisk. Within ADisk, you are just concerned with
  protecting ADisk's internal data structures and log.)</p>


  <p><b>Garbage collection</b></p>

  <p>Eventually, your log will be full of writes, some of which are
  part of committed transactions, some of which are part of aborted
  transactions, and some of which are part of in-progress
  transactions. You need to compact the log so that all of the
  in-progress records are located at the front of the log and the rest
  of the log is free. e.g., you will need to do something like the
  following</p>

<pre>
         int newIndex = 0;
         for(ii = 0; ii < ADISK_UNDO_LOG_RECORDS; ii++)
             currentRec = read record ii
             if currentRec is part of in-progress transaction
                 write currentRec to record newIndex
                 newIndex++
         for(ii = newIndex; ii < ADISK_UNDO_LOG_RECORDS; ii++)
	     clear record ii    
</pre>

  <p>Notice that if <I>(MAX_WRITES_PER_TRANSACTION + 1) *
  MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS * SECTORS_PER_UNDO_RECORD &lt
  ADISK_UNDO_LOG_SECTORS</I>, then garbage collection allows us to
  avoid deadlocks and allows all transactions to complete.</p>


  <p>To support this garbage collection, your ADisk should implement
  one additional public interfaces:</p>

  <p><b>void
  ADisk::compactLogWhenNeeded():
  </b>This function blocks until the log is full. It then compacts the
  log. Finally, it broadcasts on a condition variable to unblock any
  waiting begin, commit, abort, or write calls.</p>

  <p>Note that after you call the ADisk constructor, the application
  making use of ADisk will need to
  fork a garbage collector thread that simply does the following</p>

<pre>
         while(true)
             adisk->compactLogWhenNeeded()
</pre>

  <p>We've structured ADisk to require this external thread to simplify
  thinking about locking. In reality, you would want to hide this
  detail from the interface to ADisk.</p>
  


  <p><b>Question:</b> If the log is scanned and records are copied to
  earlier points in the log as described above, what happens if there
  is a crash during the compaction process? Can a record be lost?
  Suppose that an undo log contains multiple in-progress records for
  the same sector, can the "winning" undo entry change due to a crash
  in garbage collection?</p>


  <p><b>Other hints:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is extremely important that you get each part of the project
      completely working before you move on to the next part. Bugs here could
      manifest in very strange behavior that will be difficult to diagnose in
      higher levels of the code. A general principle in engineering complex
      systems is &quot;go from working system to working system.&quot; That is,
      build core functionality, debug it, then add a small subset of
      functionality and test that. It is much easier to find a bug by testing a
      100-line module 20 minutes after you write it than to find the same bug by
      testing the entire 2000 line system after a week of writing code. <b><i>If
      you try to write all your code first and test it later, you are very
      likely to fail this project.</i></b> If you thoroughly test each module
      and each interface as you write it, each module may seem to take 10%
      longer, but the overall project will take much less time. It is also much
      more likely to work. Thorough testing of each phase of the project is a
      requirement of this project.</li>
    <li>Begin this part of the project by writing down your main data
      structures, and then writing pseudo-code for each of the above functions
      in terms of methods on these data structures.</li>

    <li>Note that some of the updates you write to the log may exceed
    1 sector. In fact, the pseudo-code for garbage collection above
    implicitly assumed that a "log record" was two sectors long -- one
    sector to hold the update to the sector and another to hold the
    rest of the information about the transaction. This simple
    approach is adequate for this project.  But as you implement it
    (or any other approach), remember that you are only guaranteed
    that single-sector writes are atomic. Therefore, you must devise a
    way to ensure that incomplete multi-sector writes don't harm your
    system (e.g., by structuring them so that incomplete multi-sector
    writes can be detected and ignored.)</li>

<p>As your career progresses, you will find that writing simple
sanity-check tests for each object you write will save you enormous
amounts of time and make you a much more productive programmer. So, we
should not have to require you to write any specific tests because you
should already be planning to do so. But, thorough testing of this
part of the project is so important to the rest of the project, that
we're going to require it.</p>

<p>Write a program called aDiskUnit that executes a series of unit
tests for ADisk. Designing such tests is a skill that deserves
practice, so we do not provide a full list of what you should
test. You might start with simple reads and writes within a
transaction. Then look at reads and writes across transactions that
commit or abort. You shoud have some tests with a single thread and some with more.  
Should probably have some tests for the simple case when the
disk doesn't crash and some for the case where it does. Etc.</p>

<p>The TA will also have a set of unit tests (other than yours) to use
for grading your code. So, passing your tests is not necessarily
enough. But, if you design good tests, then passing your tests makes
it much more likely that you will pass the TA's tests.</p>

<p>Additional comments</p>
<UL>
<LI>Your tests must be self-checking. That is, after each test, you
should output a simple statement like "Test Succeeds" or "Test Fails."
(e.g., you should not require a human to read through 100 lines of output to
see if the read on line 92 matches the write on line 7; instead, your
unit test program should remember the earlier write it did and compare
the read result to it.)

<p>All of your implementations must adhere to (e.g., must not change) the public
interfaces specified above. You may not modify the Disk interface in any way.
You may add additional public methods to ADisk; we don't think you will need to
do so (except perhaps to add testing interfaces). Electronically turn in (1) your well commented and elegant source code and
  (2) a file called README.</p>

<p>Your README file should include 4 sections:
<ul>
<li>
Section 1: Administrative: your name (both names if you choose to work
in a 2-person team), the number of slip days that you have used
on this project and so far. Note that if you choose to work in a
two-person team, the number of slip days available to the team is the
<B>minimum</B> of the number of slip days available to each member of
the team.</li>

<li>
Section 2: A list of all source files in the directory with a 1-2 line
description of each</li>

<li>
Section 3: 1 short paragraph,&nbsp; describing the high-level design of part 1&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Section 4: A discussion of your testing strategy. Outline the programs
you used (at a high level), what each one tests, and the results of
those tests. (More detailed low-level comments should be in the
programs, themselves.)</li>
